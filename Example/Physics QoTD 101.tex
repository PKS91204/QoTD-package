\qotdtitle{101}{13}{01}
Two soap bubbles with surface tension coefficient $\sigma$ and radius $r$ are separated from each other by a planar thin soap film that has same surface tension coefficient by puncturing this membrane we can achieve a isothermal union of 2 bubbles, if the radius of newly formed bubble is $R$.

Then what is normal atmospheric pressure $P_o$ outside.

What is interval in $r$ that $R$  changes over?
